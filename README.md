## Luke Lamnisos Donovan

I am a Junior Full-Stack developer with a passion for producing high quality, highly tested code, and I'm currently seeking opportunities to hone my skills as a developer, and grow as a tech professional. My background is in Videography and motion design, which has helped me develop a breadth of creative and technical skills and a keen eye for detail.

## Skills
#### Fast learner
Especially throughout my time at Maker's Academy and in previous roles, I have a proven ability to pick-up, integrate and master new technologies and practices quickly and effectively. Through self-teaching and experience I have mastered many video production and editing softwares to a professional standard.

#### Team-player
Having worked within many teams throughout my career. I thrive in new teams and environments where I can collaborate with others and produce high quality work as a team.

#### Creative Problem solver
Through my skills as an editor and producer, I can often think of fresh, creative and unique ways to tackle a problem, which has been fundamental to my Software Development journey.

#### A keen eye for detail
Developed over years of video producing and editing, in a range of different formats, following client briefs and tracking edits.

## Projects I'm proud of

Project Name | Link | Description
--- | --- | ---
Road to Discovery | [Here](https://github.com/Team-react/Playlist_App) | A single-page React and Node application which utilises a range of APIs to produce tailored playlists quickly. As this was my first time using React, this is an example of my demonstrated ability to adopt new frameworks in a quick timeframe.
Makers BnB | [Here](https://github.com/lukedonov/makersbnb-project) | An AirBnB clone built in Ruby and Sinatra with a PSQL back-end. Here is a good example of agile, test-driven development in a team environment. 
Acebook | [Here](https://github.com/Thatguy560/acebook-5Makerteers) | This Ruby-on-Rails Facebook clone is another example of TDD in an agile team.
Luke News | [Here]() | This is a single page news application built in Javascript and Node. It utilises the Guardian API to automatically update with the latest news stories. This is the first project I have specifically designed for use as a mobile phone application.
