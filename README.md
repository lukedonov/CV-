## Luke Lamnisos Donovan

I am a highly-motivated Junior Developer with a passion for producing high quality, highly tested code, and I'm currently seeking opportunities to hone my skills as a developer, and grow as a tech professional among like-minded problem-solvers. My background is in Videography and motion design, which has helped me develop a breadth of creative and technical skills and a keen eye for detail.
